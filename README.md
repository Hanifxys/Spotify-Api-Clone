# Spotify-Api-Clone

This project interfaces with the Spotify API and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description
Built to provide users with an intuitive experience to engage with Spotify's vast collection, this clone provides seamless integration and access to a world of music.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. Refer to [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.

### `npm run build`
